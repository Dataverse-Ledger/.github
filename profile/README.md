## What it does
Dataverse Ledger is a blockchain-based ecosystem designed for secure IoT data trading. It uses a fast and efficient Virtual Machine (VM) and the Snowman consensus algorithm from the Avalanche Hypersdk framework to notarize data autonomously on-chain. This ensures data authenticity and enables producers to trade data securely with native tokens, while allowing other parties to easily verify the data.

## How we built it
We built Dataverse Ledger using the Avalanche Hypersdk framework to create a custom VM, enhancing scalability and transaction speed. Additionally, we developed a custom software/firmware for smart IoT devices, modifying a fork of Tasmota for seamless integration with Dataverse Ledger. This firmware allows devices to autonomously notarize data, ensuring security and authenticity without human intervention.
